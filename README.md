## About the project

I've followed this LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-vue-and-node-apps-with-authentication?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5d94ce0a498e93731fbb8711">course</a> offered by Alexander Zanfir.

This course demonstrates how to build an interface in Vue.js that can send information to a Node.js server and adjust to its responses, as well as make sure that only authorized users can visit.

I am on my way to achieve a :rocket: fullstack overview!
